# Candle Game

Made for November '18 Berlin Mini Game Jam with the themes "Dreams and Nightmares", "Don't Drop The..." and "Necromancy".

The aim of the Candle Game is to stay in dreamland. Colliding with the sheep will cause you to drop your candle. Plunged into nightmare darkness the player must then avoid the now undead sheep or die!
